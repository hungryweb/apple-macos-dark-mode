# Apple macOS Dark Mode
Apple introduced some semblance of a dark mode with OS X Yosemite, but it turned only the menu bar and the Dock dark.

Mojave does dark mode right.

Theme was build as closely as possible to match the native macOS Dark Mode look.

## Installation

* Add [Apple macOS Dark Mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apple-macos-dark-mode/menablioibojfoahbgdpbchjeigigmep) from the Chrome Web Store.
